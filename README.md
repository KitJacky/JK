Welcome to JK Github page!

I personally tend to gravitate towards new technologies like the Internet, blockchain, Linux, decentralization, programming languages, AI, and open source software. I'm the type of person who is intrigued by cutting-edge technologies and enjoys keeping up with the latest innovations in these areas. Advancements like sophisticated algorithms or machine learning systems fascinate me. I like being an early adopter of new technologies when possible, and I appreciate the scientific and engineering progress that enables these high-tech developments. In general, I have an affinity for technology and an enthusiasm for its advancement and future potential, especially in domains such as networking, computing, and artificial intelligence. 

I have over 20 years of experience with the Internet and new technologies. I built Hong Kong's first dating website back in 1997 and have seen the Internet grow tremendously since then. More recently, I have become interested in new innovations like blockchain technology. Since 2016, I have been actively learning about blockchain and its potential impacts. While I have deep experience with the Internet, I still approach emerging technologies like blockchain with a sense of curiosity and openness to understanding their possibilities. Over the years, my passion for technology and interest in its advancements has persisted. I continue to find innovations in areas like networking and computing both fascinating and important to follow, even after all this time exploring and building on the Internet.
